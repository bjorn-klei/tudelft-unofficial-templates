# TUDelft Unofficial Templates
---
This repository contains unofficial TU Delft templates for reports, assignments and summaries. These templates were created from the need for professional-looking, reusable LaTeX templates without unnecessary clutter. The main benefit of these templates are that they render much faster than the official templates and they do not contain any code that the average LaTeX user wouldn't be familiar with (no .sty files or internal TeX commands), meaning that the average LaTeX user can easily troubleshoot any potential errors that might occur.

## The Report template
The report template is intended to be used for large design reports (20+ pages). It contains a front page with room for up to 10 authors and a mentor, as well as the title and potential subtitle of the report. The template contains a list of figures (LoF), list of tables (LoT), list of symbols (LoS) and a bibliography in the AIAA style.

## The Assignment template
The report template is intended to be used for smaller (individual) assignments (5-20 pages). The front matter is largely the same as the report template, except that it does not contain an LoF, LoT or LoS and the table of contents is listed on the front page.

## The Summary template
